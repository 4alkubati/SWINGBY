## What is SwingBy

Dual-sided service marketplace app connecting service providers ("Businesses") with people seeking services ("Clients"). Think Uber meets Thumbtack meets Facebook Marketplace — built for Calgary, expanding to North America.

**Two user roles:** Business (solo hustler or company) | Client (person needing a service)  
**Two discovery flows:** Geo-browse (map, nearby businesses) | Post & match (client posts, businesses bid)  
**Booking flow:** Client posts → Business expresses interest → Client accepts → Booking created → Employee assigned → Date confirmed → Completed

| Auth | Supabase Auth |
| Storage | AWS S3 (not needed until file uploads) |
| Maps | Google Maps API |

## Supabase Project

- **Project name:** SWINGBY
- **Project ID:** `ulnxapnsenzyddddldjt`
- **Region:** ca-central-1
- **URL:** stored in `backend/.env` as `SUPABASE_URL`
- **Keys:** `SUPABASE_KEY` (anon) and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` (service role) — both in `backend/.env`, never committed

## Database — 10 Tables (all in Supabase)

All have RLS enabled with policies applied.

| Table | Key fields |
|---|---|
| `users` | id (uuid), first_name, last_name, email, phone, role (client/business_owner/employee), avatar_url |
| `businesses` | id, owner_id→users, business_name, category, lat, lng, service_radius_km, avg_rating, review_count, license_status |
| `employees` | id, business_id→businesses, user_id→users, role_title, is_active |
| `service_posts` | id, client_id→users, title, category, budget, status (open/matched/expired/cancelled), expires_at (+7 days) |
| `interests` | id, post_id→service_posts, business_id→businesses, quoted_price, status (pending/accepted/rejected) |
| `bookings` | id, client_id, business_id, employee_id, post_id, total_amount, status (confirmed/in_progress/completed/cancelled), payment_status |
| `payments` | id, booking_id, total_charged, escrow_held, released_to_business, platform_cut (10%), status |
| `messages` | id, booking_id, sender_id, content, sent_at |
| `reviews` | id, booking_id, reviewer_id, reviewee_id, reviewee_type (client/business), rating (1-5), comment |
| `cancellations` | id, booking_id, cancelled_by, reason, penalty_amount |

**Payment escrow logic:**
- On booking confirmed: 50% released to business, 50% held
- On job complete: remaining 50% minus 10% platform cut released (business gets 90% total)
- On cancel: 25% penalty if >48h before date, 50% penalty if ≤48h

## Backend API — All Endpoints

Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000` | Docs: `/docs`  
All routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` except signup/login/health.

PATCH  /auth/me

POST   /businesses/
GET    /businesses/
GET    /businesses/me

DELETE /service-posts/{id}

POST   /interests/

## How to Run Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
"C:/Python314/python.exe" -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

**Required `.env` keys:**
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
SECRET_KEY=...
SUPABASE_URL=https://ulnxapnsenzyddddldjt.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=sb_publishable_...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=eyJhbGci...    ← REQUIRED — server refuses to start without it
AWS_BUCKET=                          ← leave empty until file uploads needed
```

## Website Plan (web/ directory)

**Two versions to build:**

### Version 1 — Pre-launch ✅ DONE (`web/pre-launch/`)
- Coming soon / waitlist page with email capture

### Version 2 — Full launch ✅ DONE (`web/launch/`)
- 40+ routes: marketing, auth, app/dashboard (client + business)
- Analytics (Recharts), Earnings ledger, CSV/XLSX exports (ExcelJS)
- Webhook form, API keys management
- CSP headers, Sentry, Plausible analytics, WCAG 2.1 AA
- Pending: Stripe payment UI, GET /businesses/me/analytics backend endpoint,
  POST /api-keys backend endpoint + migration

## Key Design Decisions (do not change without reason)

- **One USERS table, three roles** — role checked on every protected route
- **INTERESTS as spam shield** — businesses express interest, client accepts or rejects. No direct contact before confirmation
- **post_id nullable on BOOKINGS** — supports both post-and-match AND direct geo-browse flows
- **Escrow split** — 50% on confirmation, 50% on completion, 10% platform cut from second payout
- **MESSAGES locked to confirmed BOOKINGS only** — no pre-booking chat
- **LICENSE_STATUS manual** — starts as pending, SwingBy team verifies manually. Auto-verification post-MVP
- **service_role key in backend only** — all data operations go through FastAPI, never direct Supabase from frontend
- **Haversine geo-browse** — bounding box pre-filter in Supabase + exact distance in Python. No PostGIS needed for MVP
